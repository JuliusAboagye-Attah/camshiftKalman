An object tracking project using camshift and Kalman Filter based on OpenCV

I implement an object tracking algorithm using camshift and Kalman Filter. Three features, hue,saturation and rotation invariant Local Binary Pattern, are used to model to tracking object. Kalman Filter is employed to smooth the motion trajectory and predict the next position when the object is occluded
